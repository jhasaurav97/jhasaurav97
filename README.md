# Hi, I’m Saurav Jha 👋  
Backend-leaning Full Stack Developer | Building real-world web applications

I’m a full stack developer who enjoys working across the stack, with a stronger interest in **backend logic, APIs, databases, and production issues**. I like building things end to end and understanding how systems behave outside of tutorials.

## 🚀 What I’m focused on

- Building and shipping **production-ready full-stack applications**
- Designing clean APIs and handling authentication, validation, and data flow
- Debugging real deployment issues and improving system reliability
- Writing maintainable code with clear structure
